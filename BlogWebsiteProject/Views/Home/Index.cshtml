            <p>I am Tony Nguyen. I graduated from San Diego State University (SDSU) in May 2021 with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering. 
                My hobbies are gaming, bouldering, and reading manga.</p>

            <p>The programming languages I'm the best are C# and C. I have some experience in Python from a Discord project that used the Discord.py API. 
                I have used C# professionally for about 2 years, and I have used C a little bit professionally as well. 
                Most of my embedded C experience comes from an online Udemy class I took that taught me things like SPI.
                Below is a list of my professional experiences.
